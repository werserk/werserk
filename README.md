### Hi there!

I'm Max, I'm 18. \
I'm a student of HSE FCS AMI. \
I'm mainly engaged in deep learning with computer vision, \
but now I'm also mastering other areas of IT: product management, NLP, classic ML. \
I have a lot of experience in solving medical problems, so I am interested in projects, startups, and hackathons related to medicine.
